SMELLIE consists of the following hardware components:
(the name given in [] brackets is how the component is referred to throughout the rest of the Hardware documentation)

--------------------------------------------------


* 4 Laser-heads
[lasers]
-- these produce (almost) monochromatic pulses of light at wavelengths of 375, 407, 446 and 495nm
	- see pg 1-4 of "Laser_Wavelength_Timing_Spectra.pdf
-- the pulses are very fast, on the order of <1ns
	- see pg 5-8 of "Laser_Wavelength_Timing_Spectra.pdf

--------------------------------------------------


* PicoQuant SEPIA II Laser Driver Unit
[Sepia Unit]
-- this supplies power and control to any one of the lasers, but only one at a time, since the Sepia Unit only contains a single driver unit
-- it is software-controlled, either via the manufacturer's bespoke program or using the Oxford-developed SMELLIE software

--------------------------------------------------


* Laser Switch Unit
[LaserSwitch]
-- there are 2 identical Laser Switch units ... one is at SNOLab as part of the SMELLIE system, and the other is at Oxford University
-- both were designed and built at Oxford University by Mr. Rik Elliott (r.elliott2@physics.ox.ac.uk)
-- this has two functions:

1) it allows remote and automated switching between the 4 lasers, eliminating the need for an operator to manually change which laser is being driven by the Sepia Unit by connecting the correct LEMO cable
	- it basically acts as a 1-to-4 (up to 6) LEMO adapter - taking the single set of input signals from the Sepia Unit and sending it to a user-specified "destination" laser
	- the "destination" laser can be specified either via software, or using the manual controls located on the Laser Switch itself
	- the Laser Switch front panel displays the currently active output channel (LEDs on the right side) and the currently selected output channel (8-segment display)

2) it provides mains power to the Sepia Unit
	- when changing between lasers, the Sepia Unit must be reset in order to recognise the change in lasers - this involves powering down and powering back up again
	- the Sepia Unit is powered from the mains via the Laser Switch, and therefore the latter can be used to perform this reset remotely, without needing to use the physical power switch on the Sepia Unit

--------------------------------------------------


* 4 Beamsplitters
[beamsplitters]
-- the light from each laser is split into 2 parts: one of which eventually enters the detector, and the other which is used within the SMELLIE system for internal monitoring
-- because the lasers all have slightly different intensities and attenuations through the fibres, the split-ratios may not be the same across all 4 beamsplitters

*** SECTION INCOMPLETE - include the actual splitters being used ***

--------------------------------------------------


* Laser Components 5x14 Fibre Switch Unit
[FibreSwitch]
-- this receives light from any one of the lasers via the beamsplitters, and routes to to one of 14 possible output fibres that then enter the detector
	- see "FibreSwitch_Logic_Diagrams.pdf"
-- it is a passive switch, i.e. there is no amplification of the light, and as a result there are some insertion losses
	- see "FibreSwitch_Insertion_Losses.xlsx"
-- each input/output combination is assigned a specific overall channel number between 1 and 70 inclusive, and this channel is selected using software

--------------------------------------------------


* National Instruments ADC Unit
[NI Unit]
-- this provides the SMELLIE internal trigger signal, which is a (0 - 5)V pulse at a user-specified frequency (currently 1 or 10kHz)
-- this trigger signal is also sent to the SNO+ MTC, so that the detector "knows" when to expect light to be emitted from the 14 SMELLIE fibres
-- it is software-controlled, either via the manufacturer's bespoke program or using the Oxford-developed SMELLIE software

-- the NI Unit does not contain a line-driver, and so it is not capable on its own of sending signals to both the SMELLIE hardware and the SNO+ MTC (the latter via a long 50ohm BNC cable)
-- this has been solved by attaching a line-driver circuit [NI-Driver] to the NI Unit's MTC-bound BNC output
-- there are 2 identical NI-Driver units ... one is at SNOLab as part of the SMELLIE system, and the other is at Oxford University
-- both were designed and built at Oxford University by Mr. John Saunders (j.saunders1@physics.ox.ac.uk)

*** SECTION INCOMPLETE - bit more on the NI-Driver when they are finished ***

--------------------------------------------------


* Monitoring PMT Unit
[Monitoring PMT]
-- there are 2 identical Monitoring PMT units ... one is at SNOLab as part of the SMELLIE system, and the other is at Oxford University
-- both were designed and built at Oxford University by Mr. John Saunders (j.saunders1@physics.ox.ac.uk)
	- see "Monitoring_PMT_Electronics_Analogue.pdf", "Monitoring_PMT_Electronics_Digital.pdf" and "Monitoring_PMT_Electronics_Trigger.pdf"
-- this has three functions:

1) it "decides" which trigger source - TUBii from SNO+ or internal from the NI Unit - will be used (i.e. which mode SMELLIE is operating in)
	- strictly speaking, this "decision" is purely passive - i.e. whichever source is currently producing a signal is the one that is used ... there is no actual switching between the source
	- the SMELLIE software has been written so that the trigger sources can never be producing signal simultaneously

2) it converts the standard (0 -> 5)V trigger signal produced at either source to the (-2 -> 1)V signal that the Sepia Unit requires for triggering

3) it allows per-pulse monitoring of the lasers
	- the laser intensity can change by small amounts on a pulse-by-pulse basis, and this will affect the number of photons entering the detector
	- it is therefore important to monitor the intensity, and this done by sending some of the laser light (via the beamsplitter) to a PMT which then returns a voltage signal (per pulse)
	- ideally, this voltage should remain constant over many pulses, but any deviations can be monitored in real time, and if possible, the laser settings can be adjusted to account for any changes

--------------------------------------------------


* Power Supply Unit
[PMT power supply]
-- this supplies power to the Monitoring PMT and the NI-Driver
-- there are 2 identical PMT power supplies (one for each Monitoring PMT and NI-Driver) ... one is at SNOLab as part of the SMELLIE system, and the other is at Oxford University
-- both were designed and built at Oxford University by Mr. John Saunders (j.saunders1@physics.ox.ac.uk)
-- the PMT power supply has two power outputs - these are identical and can be used interchangeably

--------------------------------------------------


* SNOdrop PC
[SNOdrop]
-- all SMELLIE control scripts are stored and run from this computer
-- for most of running time, SNOdrop will be controlled remotely via TCP/IP from ORCA - only during SMELLIE setup and diagnostics will SNOdrop be used directly
-- SNOdrop is located near or next to the ELLIE electronics rack
