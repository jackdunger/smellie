	* Testing_BarePower.jpg - photograph showing how to correctly take the bare laser power readings

-------------------------


1) Unpack all equipment and connect up power cables as follows:

- CANADIAN MAINS: Sepia Unit
				: SNOdrop
				: LaserSwitch
- TRANSFORMER + ENGLISH MULTI-ADAPTER: FibreSwitch
									 : PMT power supply
								     : ThorLabs Power Meter


2) Lasers should be set up on the breadboard using the Allen screws and key from Oxford

-------------------------


3) Laser Testing

- remember to change the power meter wavelength for each laser
- do all tests with room-lighting ON, but ZERO the meter before each measurement

- BARE readings: the photodiode should be placed directly in front of the laser
	* see "Testing_BarePower.jpg"
- Sepia Unit settings: 20Mhz internal triggering, 100% laser intensity
- Results:
	* 375nm: from Manufacturer: 0.49mW, at Oxford: 0.494mW, at SNOLab: 0.495mW
	* 405nm: from Manufacturer: 1.90mW, at Oxford: 1.990mW, at SNOLab: 1.990mW
	* 440nm: from Manufacturer: 1.80mW, at Oxford: 1.920mW, at SNOLab: 1.930mW
	* 500nm: from Manufacturer: 1.10mW, at Oxford: 1.091mW, at SNOLab: 1.068mW

- COUPLING readings: the photodiode should be connected to the end of a 1m patch-fibre, which is coupled to the laser
- use the same Sepia Unit settings as above
- Results:
	* 375nm: 0.433mW (87.5% of the bare reading above)
	* 405nm: 1.799mW (90.5%)
	* 440nm: 1.705mW (88.6%)
	* 500nm: 0.999mW (93.5%)

-------------------------


4) FibreSwitch Testing

- power connections: 2x Canadian mains from back of the LaserSwitch
                   : 1x cable between the Sepia Unit and the LaserSwitch (3-pin male-to-female)
- connect all 4 lasers via LEMO cables into the LaserSwitch channels 1 to 4
- connect all 4 lasers by optical fibre into the FibreSwitch inputs 1 to 4
- uncap all 14 FibreSwitch outputs and make sure FibreSwitch is BELOW EYE-LEVEL

- the test script will run over all 4(5) inputs, and for each one input loop over all 14 outputs
- check by eye to see if light of the correct colour is emitted from each output
- the "laser switch" argument in the test script must match the LaserSwitch channels being used

- since we only have 4 lasers, we still need to check input 5 on the FibreSwitch and channels 0 and 5 on the LaserSwitch
- repeat the test script, but with modified arguments for these combinations (see test script for details)

- Results:
	* all 6 LaserSwitch channels work, and there were no problems when switching between them
	* all input/outputs channel combinations on the FibreSwitch work (qualitatively)

-------------------------


5) Monitoring PMT Testing

- this is to check that there has been no damage to the Monitoring PMT during shipping

- connect one of the input triggers (either from the NI Unit or from TUBii), and output the TrigOut signal to a scope
	* Expect: a -1 to 2V square(ish) wave
	* Result: a -1 to 2V square(ish) wave
- connect a single laser (only 1 is required for this test) to the PMT-fibre coupling, and output the PMTOut signal to scope
	* Expect: a standard shaped PMT pulse
	* Result: a standard shaped PMT pulse
- connect the Sampled-Out signal to scope
	* Expect: a rising signal following the PMT pulse, and then hold at the peak PMT value
	* Result: a rising signal following the PMT pulse, and then hold at the peak PMT value

- CALIBRATE the PMT boxes (using the steps outlined in the separate document: "Monitoring_PMT_Calibration_Procedure.txt")
	* PMT box SN191924 was calibrated with no problems
	* PMT box SN191925 has a very slight (~20mV) initial peak on the sampled output, even after calibration (for reference, SN191924 had a peak indistinguishable from noise, <10mV)
