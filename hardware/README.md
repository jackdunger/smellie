Hardware Information
=======

* The information in this folder is for SMELLIE users to refer to while setting up and actually using the hardware  
* It also acts a repository for useful procedures and online technical data  
* More technical information will (eventually) be available in some sort of User's Manual  
* Please update this README when altering existing or adding new files  


Contents:
-------  

* __README.md__  
-- the file that you are reading right now  

* __Hardware_List_and_Information.txt__  
-- This lists all of the off-detector SMELLIE hardware components, i.e. those that are located in the ELLIE electronics rack  
-- Basic information about the functionality and usage of each component is also given  
-- For those components that have been designed and built by collaboration members, contact information has been provided  
-- If you are new to SMELLIE, please read the information in this document before attempting to use the hardware!  
-- This information should be accompanied by the following files:
    + __Laser_Spectra_Wavelength+Timing.pdf__ - plots of the wavelength and pulse-time distributions for each of the lasers (taken from the lasers' User Manual)
    + __Fibre_Specifications.pdf__ - the technical specifications of the optical fibres used by the SMELLIE system
    + __FibreSwitch_Logic_Diagrams.pdf__ - the internal switching mechanisms of the FibreSwitch, showing which input/output combinations use which switching blocks
    + __Monitoring_PMT_Electronics_v2_Analogue.pdf__ - schematic of the Monitoring PMT Analogue PCB
    + __Monitoring_PMT_Electronics_v2_Digital.pdf__ - schematic of the Monitoring PMT Digital PCB
    + __ELLIE_Rack_Full.jpg__ - a schematic of the entire ELLIE electronics rack, including the TELLIE components located in the top half
    + __ELLIE_Rack_BottomHalf.pdf__ - a schematic of the bottom half of the ELLIE electronics rack, showing the positions of the 3 SMELLIE trays
    + __ELLIE_Rack_SMELLIE_Trays.jpg__ - the layouts of the 3 SMELLIE electronics trays
