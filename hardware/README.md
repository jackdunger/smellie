Hardware Information
=======

* The information in this folder is for SMELLIE users to refer to while setting up and actually using the hardware  
* It also acts a repository for useful procedures and online technical data  
* More technical information will (eventually) be available in some sort of User's Manual  
* Please update this README when altering existing or adding new files  


Contents:
-------  

* __README.md__  
-- the file that you are reading right now  

* __Hardware_List_and_Information.txt__  
-- This lists all of the off-detector SMELLIE hardware components, i.e. those that are located in the ELLIE electronics rack  
-- Basic information about the functionality and usage of each component is also given  
-- For those components that have been designed and built by collaboration members, contact information has been provided  
-- If you are new to SMELLIE, please read the information in this document before attempting to use the hardware!  
-- This information should be accompanied by the following files:
    + __Laser_Wavelength_Timing_Spectra.pdf__ - plots of the wavelength and pulse-time distributions for each of the 4 SMELLIE lasers (taken from the lasers' User Manual)
    + __FibreSwitch_Logic_Diagrams.pdf__ - the internal switching mechanisms of the FibreSwitch, showing which input/output combinations use which switching blocks
    + __FibreSwitch_Insertion_Losses.xlsx__ - the results of testing performed at Oxford University (October 2012) to determine the light losses through the FibreSwitch as a result of fibre-coupling and attenuation
    + __Monitoring_PMT_Electronics_Analogue.pdf__ - schematic of the Monitoring PMT's Analogue PCB
    + __Monitoring_PMT_Electronics_Digital.pdf__ - schematic of the Monitoring PMT's Digital PCB
    + __Monitoring_PMT_Electronics_Trigger.pdf__ - schematic of the Monitoring PMT's Trigger-Selection PCB  
_

* __Setup_Procedure.txt__  
-- This outlines the steps that should be taken to mount the SMELLIE hardware on the 3 electronics trays that will then go into the ELLIE electronics rack  
-- These steps should be accompanied by the following files:
    + __Setup_Layout_Trays.jpg__ - the layouts of the 3 SMELLIE electronics trays
    + __Setup_Layout_Rack_SMELLIE.pdf__ - a schematic of the bottom half of the ELLIE electronics rack, showing the positions of the 3 SMELLIE trays
    + __Setup_Layout_Rack_FULL.jpg__ - a schematic of the entire ELLIE electronics rack, including the TELLIE components located in the top half  
_

* __Monitoring_PMT_Calibration_Procedure.txt__  
-- This outlines the steps that are required to correctly calibrate the Monitoring PMT prior to use  
-- Calibration only needs to be performed when the Monitoring PMT electronics have been changed or after the unit has been subjected to particularly heavy physical movement (i.e. shipping)  
-- These instructions should be accompanied by the following files:
    + __Monitoring_PMT_Calibration.jpg__ - a photograph of the inside of the Monitoring PMT unit, showing the 3 PCBs, and the 3 variable pots that need to be adjusted during calibration
    + __Monitoring_PMT_Correct_Output.jpg__ - a photograph of the expected output of the Monitoring PMT when it has been correctly calibrated  
_

* __Monitoring_PMT_LightTightness_Procedure.txt__  
-- This outlines the steps for checking that the Monitoring PMT is light-tight  
-- Possible solutions are also given for any problems that may be encountered  

* __Testing_Procedures.txt__  
-- These instructions should be used to check the status of the SMELLIE hardware  
-- Testing steps are provided for the lasers, the Sepia Unit, the LaserSwitch, the FibreSwitch and the Monitoring PMT  
-- Testing should be performed after every time the hardware is changed, or subjected to particularly heavy physical movement (i.e. shipping)  
-- These instructions should be accompanied by the following files:
    + __Testing_BarePower.jpg__ - a photograph showing the setup that should be used to check the bare power of the lasers
