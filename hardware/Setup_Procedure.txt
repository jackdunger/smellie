BEFORE CONNECTING ANY OTHER HARDWARE:
- connect the 120-to-240V transformer to the Canadian Mains power supply
- attach the UK 4-way extension socket to the transformer
- connect SNOdrop to the Canadian Mains power supply
- please also have at hand the BNC cable supplying the TUBii trigger signal, and the BNC cable leading from the ELLIE electronics rack to the CAEN ADC

--------------------------------------------------


UPPER TRAY:

1) Connect the LaserSwitch to the Canadian Mains using 2 CAN/US mains power cables (there are 2 3-pin mains sockets on the back of the LaserSwitch)
2) Connect the Sepia Unit's power socket to the back of the LaserSwitch using the male-to-female mains power cable

- at this point, please test that the LaserSwitch and Sepia Unit are powered correctly by doing the following:
3a) turn on the mains power to the LaserSwitch and turn on their individual power switches
   - both units should turn on
3b) use the channel selection button on the front of the LaserSwitch to set a different channel (any one will do), and press the "Execute" button
   - the Sepia Unit should power down, the LaserSwitch should change to the desired channel, and the Sepia Unit should turn back on
3c) turn off both units at their individual switches, and also at the mains (for safety)

4) Connect the front LEMO cable from the LaserSwitch into the socket on the front of the Sepia Unit
5) Connect the USB cables from the LaserSwitch and Sepia Unit to SNOdrop

--------------------------------------------------


MIDDLE TRAY:

1) Place the PMT power supply at the back of the tray, and connect it via UK mains power cable to the 4-way extension

2) Screw the laser-heads tightly to the breadboard using the provided Allen screws, washers and Allen key
3) Place the breadboard on the left side of the tray, with the Power Unit flush against the side of the breadboard

4) Connect the 4 lasers into the LEMO sockets on the back of the LaserSwitch (Upper Tray)
   - do not use the LaserSwitch socket 0, since this is the default LaserSwitch channel that is switched onto in case of problems
   - otherwise, the socket numbers doesn't matter, but for convenience we have previously always used channels 1 to 4 for 375, 405, 440 and 500nm respectively

- at this point, please test that the LEMO connections are working correctly by doing the following:
5a) turn on the mains power to the LaserSwitch and turn on the LaserSwitch and Sepia Unit power switches
   - both units should turn on
5b) use the channel selection button on the front of the LaserSwitch to set a channel that has a laser connected, and press the "Execute" button
   - after the Sepia Unit turns off and on again, the light on the body of the laser that is connected to the selected channel should be on
   - there is no need to uncap the lasers for this connection check - checking that the light on the laser's body turns on is sufficient
5c) repeat for the 3 other LaserSwitch channels that have laser-heads connected
5d) turn off both the Sepia Unit and LaserSwitch at their individual switches, and also at the mains (for safety)

6) Place the NI Unit at the front-left of the tray, and connect the pin-terminal-to-BNC cable that will carry the NI trigger to the Monitoring PMT

7) Place the Monitoring PMT at the front-right of the tray, and connect the 2 power cables from the PMT power supply
   - the outputs on the power unit are identical, as are the 2 gray power cables
8) Connect the BNC cables to the Monitoring PMT as follows:
   - "TUBii Trigger In": connect to the BNC cable supplying the TUBii trigger signal
   - "NI Trigger In": connect to the the short pin-to-BNC cable from the NI Unit - the cable is easily damaged, so please take care
   - "Trigger Out": connect to the Sepia Unit's (Upper Tray) Trig In socket using the small, silver connector cable provided
   - "Sampled Output": connect to the BNC cable leading from the rack to the CAEN ADC
   - "PMT Output": this can be left unconnected for the moment, since it is only used for testing purposes

9) Connect the 8-way fibre coupler into the fibre-port of the Monitoring PMT

10) Connect a beamsplitter into each of the lasers, using one of the input fibres (leave the other unused input capped)
11) Connect one of the output fibres of each beamsplitter into one of the 8-way coupler's inputs (the exact inputs used are not important, but perhaps can be noted down)
12) Connect the other remaining output fibre of each beamsplitter into a short-length patch-fibre

--------------------------------------------------


LOWER TRAY:

1) Connect the FibreSwitch into the 4-way extension using a UK mains power cable, and connect the RS232 socket into the back of SNOdrop using the RS232 cable provided

2) Connect the free ends of the 4 patch-fibres (Middle Tray, step 12) into the input channels of the FibreSwitch
   - the exact channels used are not technically important, but for convenience we have previously used channels 1 to 4 for 375, 405, 440 and 500nm respectively (mirroring the numbering for connecting the lasers to the LaserSwitch)

3) Connect the 12 SMELLIE fibres into the output channels of the FibreSwitch in whichever order you deem relevant and useful
