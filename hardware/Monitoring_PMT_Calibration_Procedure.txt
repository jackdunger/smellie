1) Connect ONE of the Trigger-In sockets to its respective trigger source (either the NI Unit or TUBii ... it does not matter which)
2) Connect the Trigger-Out socket to an oscilloscope with a 50ohm load (either physical or built into the scope)

3) With the lid screwed on securely, turn the power on to the Monitoring PMT and leave standing for 30 minutes
	- this will allow the Monitoring PMT to reach its stable operating temperature, which is important since the various offsets present in the electronics are temperature-dependent

4) Remove the lid of the Monitoring PMT

-- the following 2 steps 5) and 6) must be performed IN THE SPECIFIED ORDER
-- see "Monitoring_PMT_Setup.jpg" for visual aid
5) Connect a multimeter (with the highest DC voltage resolution scale) to the PMT-Out socket, and adjust the RV2 variable pot (located in the middle of the analogue board) until the multimeter reads exactly 0.
6) Connect the multimeter to the Sampled-Out socket, and adjust the RV1 variable pot (located at the corner of the analogue board) until the multimeter reads exactly 0.
	
In both of these steps, the multimeter reading will pass through an inflection point as the pot is turned (i.e. the voltage will go from negative to positive, through zero).

7) Remove the multimeter, and attach a BNC cable from the Sampled-Out socket to the oscilloscope with a 50ohm load (this simulates the 50ohm load present on the CAEN ADC)
8) Attach the Trigger-Out socket via BNC to the Sepia Unit's external trigger socket, and take a branch to the oscilloscope, now with a 1Mohm load on the scope (this waveform can be turned off since viewing it is not actually required)
9) Set the scope to trigger off the RISING EDGE of the Trigger-Out channel

-- see "Monitoring_PMT_Setup.jpg" for visual aid
10) Adjust the Timing Pot (located on the digital board) to give the maximum Sampled-Out voltage on the scope
	- adjusting the timing pot will have the following effects:
	a) it will change the width of the Trigger-Out pulse, but since the scope is triggering off the rising edge of the Trigger-Out signal, this edge will remain fixed in time
	   (i.e. only the falling edge of the Trigger-Out pulse will shift left and right)
	b) it will increase or decrease the Sampled-Out signal's hold-voltage value - this will go through a maximum value as the pot is adjusted

--------------------------------------------------


Once all of these steps are performed, the Monitoring PMT's lid can be replaced and screwed back on - it is now ready for use.

To check that the Monitoring PMT is correctly set up:
- connect the Trigger-Out, PMT-Out and Sampled-Out sockets via BNC cable to an oscilloscope, with the first two using 1Mohm loading and the last with 50ohm loading
- display the PMT-Out channel only, and adjust the gain pot on the Monitoring PMT so that the peak voltage on the PMT-Out channel is 2.00V (or as close as possible)
- display all 3 channels on the same timing and voltage scales, grounded at the same level
	* the outputs should now look as shown in "Monitoring_PMT_Correct_Output.jpg"
